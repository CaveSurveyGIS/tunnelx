List of things to do. *urgent +preferable





The back bitmap image controls to clean up.  (Shift image buttons)


Subset mode somewhere, for handling them.  (Box of active subsets, and new subset thing).  Move off the menu.  



Render two nodes vertically coincident.  (Fuse and keep the line).  Make them individually selectable by a series of outlines (diamond box).  Cycle through in selection.  Vertical lines are take or leave.  Don't matter, don't see.  centreline ones might be important.  



Loading and matching by shared node endpoint, not node number.  


Can then have files that are broken up by subset, but can merge together.  no duplicate nodes, and duplicate lines merged.  Maybe give by names in the <sketch name=""> for each file.  Then would need to scan the files pre-loading.  



These files could be edited separately, but with warnings if you dragged something along that was part of a thing in another subset-file



Dragging of labels.  













Background images:
+ get images working properly (and with a separate path variable)

Automatic Updates:
+ make everything update automatically


Lines:
+ review the changeability of the linetypes
+ Spline across nodes
+ Length and direction of lines on side bar for drawing to scale
+ Fix number on grid size

Symbols:
+ symbol layout done using bitmap technology.
+ review symbols options
+ Only try to put symbols within area
+ Put down symbols specifying a density rather than total number
+ Symbol type that fills area it occupies

File Managment:
+ Load files as required
+ Save user inputted XML nicely
+ Warning if not all files saved when exiting
+ Option to delete files within tunnel
+ Allow files to be saved separately
+ back up file before saving
+ MsgBox if save not successful
+ Do not over write files if save unsucesfull.
+ Remove * when sketches saved

Rendering
+ When putting blank lines behind other lines, do so that there are not gaps between lines at nodes
+ slicing along planes other than z and other means
+ rendering above and below passages, and hidden kinds in grey. [effective with colour]

Line types:
+ Cross section line, either connected by a line to the cross section or with a reference to the cross section.

Print Preview:
+ Automatic grid, borders
+ Title Captions
+ Printing to arbitary scale [done]
