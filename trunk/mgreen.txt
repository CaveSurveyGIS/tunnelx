rebuild the labels from the xml 
need a flag to say if an area is not to be filled 

	<areamess signal="outside-island"/>

symbols to pull in text??  



Labels:

I would be keen to improve the text a bit, different text sizes are vital really,
unless I am going to finish of the survey in open office.  Also the ability to save
spaces in the text would be good.  A carrage return would also be usefull.


Layers:

I am keen for Tunnel to be able to dash the passage walls when one passage goes under
another, (else I cound spend ages doing this by hand like last year).
I am also keen to split the final survey into three, and would like to specify the
breaks myself.  How hard would it be to produce a file, which specified the closest
survey station (by connectivity) to each node in a particualar tunnel xml file.  From
this I could perl munge the desired results.


 
================



> 
QMs
Arial 12 Mainy
Arial 9,11 For places with little room

Passage names
Arial 14

pitches, climbs and chokes
Arial 12

Grid markings
Arial24
Survey Title
Arial Black 72
Arial 36
Arial Black 32
Arial 32 


Mark up flags might be good.  For: 

QM
choke
pitch/climb
Cave area
Passage name


The Survey Title etc could be done similarly.  I am tempted to make it a symbol, 
this would require symbols to pull in text with them.  This would be good for the
scale bar as well.




Yes, this shoukd not be too hard starting from a pos file.  This would allow
consistancy of where the joins are, rather than having to do it graphicaly three time
and getting them to match.  My upper sketch I want to show all the lower stuff
dashed, then my middle level I want to show the very bottom bit dashed.  It would
also allow a simple script to be run when the master survey is updated, i.e. when
everyone points out all my mistakes.  This script could also add the grid lines, and
survey title.




List of things to do. *urgent +preferable

Extras

+ review the symbol options 
+ don't load everything at once 
+ get images working properly (and with a separate path variable) 
+ review the changeability of the linetypes 
+ make everything update automatically 
+ symbol layout done using bitmap technology.  
+ slicing along planes other than z and other means 
+ rendering above and below passages, and hidden kinds in grey.  



Connectivity:

* Morph by connectivity

Lines:

+ Spline across nodes
+ Length and direction of lines on side bar for drawing to scale
+ Fix number of grid size


Symbols:
+ Symbol that pulls in text as well as drawings
+ Real time update SAreas?
+ Real time update symbol layers?
+ Symbol type that fills area it occupies


Saving:
+ Warning if not all files saved when exiting
+ Option to delete files within tunnel
+ Allow files to be saved separately
+ back up file before saving
+ MsgBox if save not successful
+ Do not over write files if save unsucesfull.
+ Remove * when sketches saved


Line types:
+ Cross section line, either connected by a line to the cross section or with a reference to the cross section.

This is what happens when you try to load merrygoround3/meerygoround3-sketch0.xml Then some of the lines come up for that survey.
