# Tunnel Cave Survey editor

This 2.5D drawing program is [Survex](http://survex.com) data compatible and can also read and render PocketTopo files.  

Developed since 1999 and used primarily to draw up [http://expo.survex.com/](CUCC Austria caves) and the [http://cave-registry.org.uk/nengland](Three Counties System).  

The defining feature (ie why you cannot use a standard drawing software for this application) is the ability to distort the maps to fit to changes to the underlying survey network.  

The main alternative to Tunnel is [Therion](http://therion.sk), which also solves this problem, but in a completely different manner and with a slightly steeper learning curve.
