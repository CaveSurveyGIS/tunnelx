# Tunnel Cave Survey editor

This is [Survex](http://survex.com) compatible and can read and render PocketTopo files.  

Developed since 1999 and used primarily to draw up CUCC Austria caves and the Three Counties System.  

The defining feature (ie why you cannot use a standard drawing software for this application) is the ability to distort the maps to fit to changes to the underlying survey.  

The main alternative to Tunnel is [Therion](http://therion.sk), which also solves this problem, but in a completely different way.
