# Introduction #

Tunnel is a [free](http://www.gnu.org/) [Java](http://sun.java.net/) 2.5D cave drawing program surveys based on [Survex](http://www.survex.com/)-compatible data which can also read and [PocketTopo](http://paperless.bheeb.ch/) files.

It is used primarily to draw up [CUCC Austria caves](http://expo.survex.com/) and the [Three Counties System](http://cave-registry.org.uk/nengland).  

The defining feature (ie why you cannot use a standard drawing software for this application) is the ability to distort the maps to fit to changes to the underlying survey network.  

The main alternative to Tunnel is [Therion](http://therion.sk), which also solves this problem, but in a completely different manner and with a slightly steeper learning curve.
