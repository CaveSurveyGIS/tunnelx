               <h2>Introduction to TunnelX</h2>
      
               <p>Welcome to TunnelX, a free Cave drawing system that depends on Survex and which does the 
               same thing as Therion, except completely different.  
               See the <a href="https://github.com/CaveSurveying/tunnelx">TunnelX GitHub page</a> for updates and development.</p>
               
         
               <p>If this is your first time using TunnelX, try opening the tutorials and double-clicking 
               on the first one.</p>

                <p>The <span class="tab_heading">img</span> tab has a <span class="tab_heading">Snap to grid</span> feature where you can change the grid spacing.</p>
                <p>Centreline paths cannot be deleted without setting the menu <span class="tab_heading">Action</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Allow Delete Centreline</span>.</p>
                <p>The <em>Pitch Bound</em> and <em>Ceiling Bound</em> paths have a dash on one side to show the direction of the 
                'whiskers' (always to the right according to the direction it was drawn).  Click <span class="tab_heading">Reflect</span> to reverse it.</p>
                <p>Connecting to the correct node among an overlapping set (some will be drawn as diamonds and pentagons) 
                is possible by dragging away from the <em>Control+Left Mouse</em> selected node without releasing it in

                <p>Click the <span class="important_info">Right Mouse Button</span> on the desired path 
                whilst (optionally) holding down the <em>Shift</em> or <em>Control</em> keys.

            <div class="help-section" id="centreline">
                <h2>Centreline Data</h2>
       
                <p>TunnelX is <a href="http://www.survex.com">Survex</a> based.
                Either use <span class="tab_heading">Import</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Import survex file</span> to load the centreline data, or 
                do <span class="tab_heading">File</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Open survex...</span> from the Main window.  
                The centreline data can be previewed by selecting the dotted green (connective) 'S' to see the label text, 
                or do <span class="tab_heading">Import</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Wireframe view</span> to see the centreline in <em>Survex-Aven</em>.</p>
       
                <p>If <em>Survex</em> is not found, <span class="tab_heading">Import</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Use Survex</span> should be disabled, 
                and TunnelX's computation (without loop closures) will be used.</p>
       
                <p>Do <span class="tab_heading">Import</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Import centreline</span> to load the geometry defined by the <em>Survex</em> data.</p>
       
                <p>You can import a centreline as an elevation by including the line:<br>
                <code>;IMPORT_AS_ELEVATION 60</code><br>
                somewhere in the survex file (where 60 is the angle of projection).  
                All this does is loads it through a transformation which swaps the y axis for the z axis.
                </p>

            <div class="help-section" id="backgrounds">
                <h2>Backgrounds</h2>
       
                <p>Select the <span class="tab_heading">img</span> tab for loading and moving the background image.
                <span class="tab_heading">Add image</span> adds a new image to the background.</p>
                
                <p><span class="tab_heading">Select image</span> requires the rectangle outline of an image to be selected.  
                Alternatively, use the drop-down box of visible background images.</p>
                
                <p>Move the selected image into position by drawing a single line path and clicking 
                on the <span class="tab_heading">Shift ground</span> button.  
                Rotate and resize the image by drawing a three point (two line) path before clicking 
                <span class="tab_heading">Shift ground</span> -- 
                the first point is the centre of rotation while the second point is moved to the third point.</p>
                
                <p>Always connect the corner of the rectangle outline of the image to part of the passage 
                it depicts so that it stays in place when the passage moves.</p>
                
                <p><em>Not done yet:</em> It will be possible to draw smaller areas to trim out from the 
                big rectangular paper to show only what is required and to make it possible to render multiple background 
                images without too much undesirtable overlapping.  
                This may also be used to bring together scattered cross-sectional outlines.</p>

                Double-click (or select it and do <span class="tab_heading">Tunnel</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">View sketch</span>) to work on the drawing.
                Open a new file using <span class="tab_heading">File</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Open sketch...</span>.</p>
       
                <p>The file name is <em>green</em> when it is loaded and up to date,

                <p>From the drawing window, use <span class="tab_heading">File</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Save as...</span> to give it a different name.</p>
       
                <p>To copy another sketch into the current sketch (while distorting to fit the centreline), 
                select it in the Main window and do <span class="tab_heading">Import</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Import down sketch</span>.  
                Always preview the import using <span class="tab_heading">Preview down sketch</span>.</p>
       
                <p>Sketches can be downloaded from the internet by pasting their 'http://...' url into the file open dialog.</p>

                <h2>Areas</h2>
       
                <p>The <span class="tab_heading">Update areas</span> button creates the areas of the sketch by finding the 
                closed outlines of series of paths that are properly joined up at their nodes.  
                Paths of type <em>Centreline</em> and <em>Connective</em> are ignored, 
                but <em>Invisible</em> paths count.  
                
                Preview the areas with <span class="tab_heading">Display</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Stripe areas</span>.  
                If areas do not appear, check for failed joins or unintended crossings near nodes, 
                and that the area itself does not self-intersect.</p>
                
                <p>Disconnected features or rock pillars within an area must be joined with an 
                <em>Invisible</em> path.  
                The filling in of a rock pillar is disabled by drawing a <em>Connective</em> path 
                into it from one of the nodes, clicking <span class="tab_heading">Area signal</span> 
                and selecting <em>rock</em> from the drop-down box.

               (by connectivity).  Compute this by clicking the <span class="tab_heading">Update Node Z</span> button.  
               The areas will be sorted by their average altitude and rendered in order.</p>
      
               <p>Paths (and their areas) can be forced to a relative altitude by connecting them 
               by a <em>Connective</em> line to a centreline node, clicking <span class="tab_heading">Area signal</span>, 
               selecting <em>zsetrelative</em> and changing the <code>0.0</code> to

               create an  <em>Invisible</em> path beneath it connected by two <em>Connective</em> paths, 
               which can be used for connecting a passage that breaks through the wall below the pitch.
               This is necessary because you cannot connect three areas to one path.</p>
      
               <p>Select an area and do <span class="tab_heading">Display</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Thin Z Selection</span> to restrict the

                <h2>Symbols</h2>
       
                <p>Symbols are placed on <em>Connective</em> paths.  
                They are always part of the area they point into from the node they join

                <p>You can open a .top file by doing 
                <span class="tab_heading">File</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Open survex...</span> from the Main window and selecting it.  
                This will open both plan and elevation drawings into the same sketch and put the 
                survey data into the label of the big green 'S'.</p>
       
                <p>Unfortunately, this TOP file cannot be used natively in TunnelX because the lines tend to be 
                disconnected and sketchy, so you will need to copy and paste the Survex data into its own text file and 
                link it into the rest of the data by hand, and then render the drawings into two .png files by 
                selecting the <span class="tab_heading">subs</span> tab, then picking <em>plan_TOP</em> in the <em>_Unattributed_</em> folder 
                before going to the <span class="tab_heading">print</span> tab and rendering the image to a PNG file.  
                (Don't forget to reset the dots/inch to a higher value for a better quality image.)
                Do the same for the <em>elev_TOP</em> subset.  
                It is important for the subset style to be "pockettopo" for the colours to come out.  
                Now you can reload the whole survex file and 
                add the rendering as the background image ready to be traced over.</p>
       
                <p>To render the elevation centreline from a TOP survex file, open the .svx file from the Main window 
                and click <span class="tab_heading">Back</span> to get rid of the plan view.  Now you can do 
                <span class="tab_heading">Import</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Import Centreline Elev</span> to generate the extended elevation of this centreline.  
                The legs that contain <em>flip_TOP</em> are oriented left to right, as well as

                <p>To make a cross section, draw a <em>Connective</em> line from a node in one wall across the passage 
                into a node in the other wall.  Then (with the path selected) do <span class="tab_heading">Elevation</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">XC Subset</span> to 
                create the new subset (with a name of the form "XC something") and the axis of the cross section 
                (as a disconnected centreline piece).  Move and fit this axis to the cross section (using <span class="tab_heading">Fuse</span> and <span class="tab_heading">Component</span>) 
                and then draw around the cross section (connecting it to the axis).  
                Note that an arrow pointer moves along the corresponding path cutting the passage for the purpose of lining up features 
                between the plan and the cross section.</p>
       
                <p>To make an extended elevation, draw a <em>Connective</em> line from a centreline node (or a node immediately connected to a centreline) 
                to another such node, then do <span class="tab_heading">Elevation</span> -&gt; <span class="tab_heading">Elevation Subset</span> to generate a long centreline path 
                for use as the axis in the elevation drawing.</p>
       
                <p>After the elevation has been drawn (with all the paths in the "ELEV" subset), the endpoint of the centreline axis 
                can be moved (using <span class="tab_heading">Fuse</span>) to stretch and fit the pieces together.</p>
       
                <p>Use the <span class="tab_heading">img</span> tab to see what is happening when the elevation/cross section drawing and corresponding

                using standard image handling software.  The printing area is either the bounding box for 
                the currently selected subset (set through the <span class="tab_heading">subs</span> tab), or the viewable graphics area.
                Select the subset for the <em>A1 frame</em> to produce a consistent result.</p>
       
                <p>The dimensions stated in <em>Real dimensions:</em> correspond to a 
                baseline scale of <code>1:1000</code>, so a 500m wide cave will be 50cm on the paper.  
                Vary the pixel dimensions by changing the resolution in dots per inch (on this 1:1000 paper).</p>
       
                <p>The directory for output and name of file are listed below.</p>
       
                <p>Because the same sketch may appear as in different <em>subset styles</em>, 
                a proper rendering may require the symbols to be layed out multiple times.  
                Select <em>Full draw</em> to enable this, or preview using one of the 
                lesser modes.</p>
       
                <p>Other options include output to <em>Gray scale</em> and <em>Transparent</em> colour to make the white 
                areas alpha=0 for use in other graphics packages.</p>
       
                <p><em>Requires re-implementation:</em> If the centreline is in the right coordinate space, click on 
                <span class="tab_heading">Overlay</span> to render it and upload it to the cave map overlay automatically, for maximum 
                speed of publication.</p>
